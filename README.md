# MET Landing Page

Welcome to the MET Landing Page project! This project is inspired by the Met web site. The layout has been crafted with precision to match the design specifications and includes interactive elements for a seamless user experience.

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project Stands Out

- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons, menu items, and forms are fully functional.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Links in the top and bottom menus lead to the appropriate sections on the page with smooth scrolling effects.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and looks great on all devices without any horizontal scrolling.
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized for quick loading to enhance user experience.
- **User Feedback**: Includes hover styles, smooth animations, and clear form placeholders with validation instructions.
- **Performance**: The page loads quickly, providing a smooth user experience.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Sass**: For efficient and modular CSS.
- **HTML5**: For the page structure.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and smooth scrolling effects.
